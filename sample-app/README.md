# Sample application

This is a super simple JAX-RS RESTEasy Spring Boot application just to exercise RESTEasy Spring Boot starter.<br>

## Starting the application

You can start the application as you for any other regular Spring Boot application. For example:

1. From the command line, under the sample application project, run `mvn spring-boot:run`
1. From your favorite IDE, run class `com.test.Application`

## Testing it

Send a `POST` request message, containing the payload below, to [http://localhost:8080/sample-app/echo](http://localhost:8080/sample-app/echo).

```
is there anybody out there?
```

You can use the following command to send the request:

```bash
$ curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/sample-app/echo' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw 'is there anybody out there?'
```

You should receive a response message with a payload similar to this as result:

``` json
{
    "timestamp": "1484775122357",
    "echoText": "is there anybody out there?"
}
```

The request message payload can be anything as plain text.
The response message is supposed to echo that, plus a timestamp of the moment the echo response was created on the server side. The response message will be in JSON format.
